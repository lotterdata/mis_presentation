## Real Goal: Understanding players' preferences

- Players prefer some numbers, such as family birthdays, 7's, etc.
- Direct data exist but are not public, so how can we document this? 
- Can back out by relating number of winners to numbers drawn.
- Number of winners is only informative if total number of players is known. 
- Otherwise we can model parimutuel prizes as a function of the numbers drawn.
